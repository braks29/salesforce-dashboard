# Salesforce Dashboard

A modern, responsive dashboard for visualizing Salesforce opportunities with two specialized views:

- **Bi-Week View**: "What did we create this week?" - Shows opportunities grouped by creation day (Mon/Tue/Wed)
- **Five-Yard View**: "How close are we to wiring money?" - Shows opportunities by sales stage (Engaged/Five-Yard/Closed-Won)

## Features

### üéØ Two Specialized Views

- Yellow border and clock icon
- Follow-up reason indicator

- Responsive design that works on desktop and mobile
- Kanban-style card layout

2. **"Authentication failed"**
   - Reset your Salesforce security token
   - Check if your password has changed
   - Verify the login URL (use https://test.salesforce.com for sandboxes)
